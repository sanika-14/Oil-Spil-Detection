# Oil Spill Detection Using U-Net and DeepLabV3

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting oil spills in the ocean using satellite imagery, utilizing deep learning models such as **U-Net** and **DeepLabV3** for semantic segmentation. The goal is to automate the detection of oil spills, enabling faster response and minimizing environmental damage.

## Models Used
- **U-Net**: A powerful architecture for image segmentation, specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation, which we adapted for oil spill detection.
- **DeepLabV3**: A state-of-the-art model for semantic image segmentation, which uses atrous convolution for more accurate detection of objects, especially for complex scenarios like oil spills.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle. It contains satellite images with oil spills labeled for segmentation tasks. You can access the dataset here:
